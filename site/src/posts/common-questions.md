###### Can I remain at VIP1?
Absolutely, it's entirely possible for you to stay at VIP1, and within a span of 30 days, your potential earnings could reach up to $345.

###### Can I withdraw my balance to my bank account?
Certainly! You have the capability to achieve this. Initially, you need to transfer your balance to a cryptocurrency wallet like Kraken. Follow this [guide](/posts/wdc-to-kraken/) for step-by-step instructions. Once completed, you can convert the balance into GBP and withdrawal to your bank account.

###### How does the referral system work?
Anyone who uses your referral code becomes your level 1 referral. If your referrals also refer someone using their codes, those new people become your level 2 referrals. This pattern continues, with each level representing the depth of referrals. For instance, if person A is the starting point and they refer person B, person B becomes a level 1 referral. If person B refers person C, then person C becomes a level 2 referral. If person C refers person D, person D becomes a level 3 referral, and so on. 

###### How do I progress to the next level?
WDC Quantify operates primarily on a referral-based system, meaning that advancing through the VIP levels is based upon achieving a specific number of referrals. As you ascend the VIP ladder, your capacity to quantify (achieve this by pressing the big blue button) also increases. The list below explains the rules for moving forward:
 - **VIP0**: Default level upon account creation (Quantify frequency: 5)
 - **VIP1**: Activate your account by depositing $35 (Quantify frequency: 5)
 - **VIP2**: 2 - level 1 &amp; 5-  level 2 - 4 (Quantify frequency: 6)
 - **VIP3**: 5 - level 1 &amp; 10 - level 2 - 4 (Quantify frequency: 7)
 - **VIP4**: 10 - level 1 &amp; 20 - level 2 - 4 (Quantify frequency: 8)
 - **VIP5**: 15 - level 1 &amp; 35 - level 2 - 4 (Quantify frequency: 9)
 - **VIP6**: 25 - level 1 &amp; 50 - level 2 - 4 (Quantify frequency: 10)
