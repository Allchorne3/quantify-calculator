9. Select **trc20-USDT)** as the address type.
10. Enter a password (you will need to remember this) and select **Continue**.
11. You will be brought back to the withdrawal page. From here select **Choose withdrawal account**, then **Digital currency wallet** (this is the wallet you have just set up).
12. Enter the amount that you want to withdraw and enter the password that you setup in step 10.
13. Click **Withdraw** and your withdrawal should now appear in Kraken, (it may take a few minutes to appear).

If you want to withdraw your Kraken balance into your bank account, you will need to convert it back to **Sterling pounds (GBP)**. It will then be possible to withdraw to your bank from there.
