1. First go into WDC Quantify and click the **Mine** tab.
2. Click **Withdrawal** and then **Choose withdrawal account**.
3. Click **Add digital currency wallet**. You will now be on the wallet details page.
4. At this point, you will need to open **Kraken**. 
5. Click the purple button in the bottom center and click **Deposit**.
6. Find **Tether(USDT)** and select it. On the next section choose **Tron** (this is very important).
7. This will then bring up your Kraken wallet address. Copy the **USDT deposit address** and head back to WDC Quantify.
8. You should be on the **Add digital currency wallet**. Paste the **USDT deposit address** into the **wallet address** field.
9. Select **trc20-USDT** as the address type.
10. Enter a password (you will need to remember this) and select **Continue**.
11. You will be brought back to the withdrawal page. From here select **Choose withdrawal account**, then **Digital currency wallet** (this is the wallet you have just set up).
12. Enter the amount that you want to withdraw and enter the password that you setup in step 10.
13. Click **Withdraw** and your withdrawal should now appear in Kraken, (it may take a few minutes to appear).

If you want to withdraw your Kraken balance into your bank account, you will need to convert it back to **Sterling pounds (GBP)**. It will then be possible to withdraw to your bank from there.
