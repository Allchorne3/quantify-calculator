Meet WDC Quantify, the cryptocurrency auto-trading bot that buys and sells digital currencies to make small profits. All you need to do is click a button five times a day.

To get started, just deposit a minimum of $35 (Â£30) to activate your account. After that, you don't have to put in any more money unless you want to. Plus, when you sign up, you'll receive $8 in your account, giving you a starting balance of $43.

With WDC Quantify, you begin as a VIP1 member, and you earn between 2.3% to 2.5% of your account balance every day. This means the more money you have in your account, the more you earn. For example, if you have $43 in your account, you'll make about $0.90 (2.3% of $43) that day, your earnings then get added to your balance, and the next day you earn 2.3% of the new amount. Just keep in mind that it takes three days to see your balance update, but after that, it updates daily.

Once your balance reaches $500, you've hit the maximum earnings for a level 1 account. So, every day, you'll earn $11.50 (2.3% of $500), which adds up to $345 in 30 days. If you only deposit the initial $35, it'll take just under four months to reach this point. It might sound like a long time, but it goes by quickly. Of course, you can speed up reaching that $500 balance by depositing more money.

To move up to higher account levels, you'll need to refer people. Two level 1 referrals and five level 2-4 referrals are required. When you refer someone, they become your level 1 referral. If your level 1 referral refers someone else, that person becomes your level 2 referral, and so on. Level 2 accounts earn more, with daily returns ranging from 2.5% to 2.9% of a maximum of $2000, which is about $50 a day and $1500 in 30 days.

You can also earn commission from any of your referrals and their referrals. Starting at 12% commission daily. You can see [more details here](/posts/common-questions/#:~:text=How%20much%20commission%20can%20I%20earn%20from%20my%20referrals%3F)
