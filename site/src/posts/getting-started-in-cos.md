1. Visit [https://cosetek.com/](https://cosetek.com/) and select any of the tabs along the bottom to prompt the user login screen to appear. Simply click the **To register** button underneath the **Log in** button.

2. Upon signup, you will need to enter an invite code. You can use this code M2J9FC or visit [https://www.cosetek.com/?tid=M2J9FC](https://www.cosetek.com/?tid=M2J9FC) to signup. Once your account is created, you should be logged in. If not, then simply log in with the account you have just created. You should find a free $6 welcome bonus in your account.

3. To get started, you will need to deposit a minimum of $51 (£42) to activate your COS account. For this, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet. I use Kraken because it is very well known and reliable.

4. Create a Kraken account and deposit your funds. It is a fairly straight forward process. You can find an easy to follow [how-to guide here](/posts/kraken-to-cos/). (Due to Kraken fees, I would suggest depositing £45 just to cover the Kraken withdrawal fees and make sure that you have the $51 that you need.

5. Give it a few minutes and you should then be at the stage where you have got funds in your COS Account. Roughly $57 minimum.

6. Along the bottom you’ll see 5 tabs. Home, My team, Quantify, Customer service and Mine. Click Quantify. Now you should see a big button that says **Single start quantification(4/4)**. Click this button. You can do this 4 times. 

7. That’s it. You are setup to quantify and earn a profit. You can deposit more funds if you want to. Or you can just use the funds in your account.
